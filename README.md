## Overview 

The typesrcipt code along challenge, it was easy to code along until I realised that there is more to code along with this challenge.
The biggest challenge was the npm installation as it kept giving errors and also had to change some of the packages that came with the repo as the webpack was outdated .


i have so many commints that i didn't know what to write anymore, hopefully they all make sense as it might affect the marks.
